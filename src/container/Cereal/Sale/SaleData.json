Even though the boxes get smaller, they still pack a wholesome sugary kick and remind me of times of yesteryears when I used to eat them all the time...lunch, dinner, midnight snack. Ahh, those were the days. But hey, I'm an adult now. I can eat these whenever I want, STILL, and THEY'RE GR-R-REAT!",

In just one bowl of Special K there is 20% of their daily intake. What other cereal offer that?? My husband and I are very happy with the decision to buy special k. Riboflavin may not seem important, but has been proven that kids with a riboflavin deficiency do not do as well in school, and are more prone to substance abuse. Thank you Kelloggâ€™s and that you special k for making a quality product.",

You can either make the muffins or leave in the bowl (refridgerated) and use as needed. Was a big hit in my family and neighborhood. Ready to make a second batch.",
