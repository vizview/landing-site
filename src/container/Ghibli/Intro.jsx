        The Colors in Ghibli Posters
      </h1>

        If you fall in love with one Studio Ghibli film, 
        then you must try out the other ones. As big fans of the films, 
        we have noticed that there might be some commonalities among them.
        Therefore, we decided to look at all 21 official movie posters of
        Studio Ghibli to investigate whether there is a pattern in the colors used.
